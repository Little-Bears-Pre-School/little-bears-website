#Â About Us

## The Little Bears Team

We have an experienced, fully qualified and friendly team, which consists of our
supervisor and three members of staff, all of whom are DBS checked.  Staff have
paediatric first aid and level 2 food hygiene qualifications.

Staff regularly attending training to continue their personal development (CPD)
in order to provide the highest standard of childcare within the setting.

All children at Little Bears are assigned an individual member of staff, to act
as their &ldquo;key person&rdquo;. They are always happy to speak to
parents/guardians about any aspect of their child's time at Little Bears.

We have a designated Safeguarding Lead &amp; Deputy, Language Lead and a SENCO
Officer (Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator) who undergo specialist
training.

All members of staff also have safeguarding training. A copy of our Safeguarding
policy is included on our [Policies](policies) page.

We currently have three designated Safer Recruiting team members.

## Early Years Foundation Stage

An integral part of our daily routine is the Early Years Foundation Stage
(EYFS).  This is a structure of learning, development and care for children
which enables your child to learn through a range of activities.

* Children learn through play
* Providers work closely with parents
* Parents are kept up to date on their child's progress
* The welfare, learning and all-round development of children with
  different backgrounds and levels of ability, including those with
  special educational needs and disabilities.


## Our Curriculum Statement

Little Bears is about supporting children's learning through play and helping
them to be &lsquo;school-ready&rsquo;.  We aim to help every child to become
independent, confident, socially interactive and have a rich vocabulary by the
time they go to school. Every support is given to them to help them develop at
their own pace and reach their optimum potential in every area. We want all our
Little Bears to have fun, feel happy and safe in the learning rich environment
that we offer.

## The Committee

An elected parent committee manages the business of Little Bears, which
ensures all decisions affecting Little Bears are taken by the parents. The
Committee consists of three officers (the Chair, the Secretary and the
Treasurer) and a number of other committee members. 

The Committee usually meets once per term to discuss all aspects of running
Little Bears as well as look at new ideas for the Pre-School and how we can
improve. All committee members are volunteers and as such we are always
looking for new members to help out with the various aspects involved in
running the Pre-School.
