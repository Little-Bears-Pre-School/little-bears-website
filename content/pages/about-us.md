    our supervisor and three members of staff, all of whom are DBS checked.  Staff

    (CPD) in order to provide the highest standard of childcare within the
    setting.

    All children at Little Bears are assigned an individual member of staff, to
    act as their "key person". They are always happy to speak to parents/guardians
    about any aspect of their child's time at Little Bears.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have a designated Safeguarding Lead &amp; Duputy, Language Lead and a SENCO
    Officer (Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator) who undergo specialist
    training.

    All members of staff also have safeguarding training. A copy of our
    Safeguarding policy is included on our <a href="/policies.html">Policies</a> page.

  <h2>The Committee</h2>
  <p>
    An elected parent committee manages the business of Little Bears, which
    ensures all decisions affecting Little Bears are taken by the parents. The
    Committee consists of three officers (the Chair, the Secretary and the
    Treasurer) and a number of other committee members. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The Committee usually meets once per term to discuss all aspects of running
    Little Bears as well as look at new ideas for the Pre-School and how we can
    improve. All committee members are volunteers and as such we are always
    looking for new members to help out with the various aspects involved in
    running the Pre-School. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We currently have 3 designated Safer Recruiting team members.

    <li>Providers work closely with parents</li>
    <li>Parents are kept up to date on their child's progress</li>
