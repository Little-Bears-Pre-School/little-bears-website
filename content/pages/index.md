## Who we are

Little Bears Pre-School is based in Stadhampton, South Oxfordshire and operates
from purpose built premises in the grounds of the village Primary School
in nearly half an acre of gardens, which includes our own nature reserve.

Established in 2004, Little Bears is an integral part
of the community, providing excellent quality care where children can
flourish. Our aim has always been to provide high quality childcare and
education within a community Pre-School.

We are a member of the Pre-School Learning Alliance, Ofsted registered and
a registered charity (charity number 1099694).

Our last Ofsted inspection carried out in September 2023 rated Little Bears as
&ldquo;Good&rdquo;. See [the inspection report](https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/16/EY271846) on the Ofsted website.
