  <h2>Who we are</h2>
  <p>
    Little Bears Pre-School is based in Stadhampton, Oxfordshire and operates
    from purpose built premises in the grounds of the village Primary School
    in nearly half an acre of gardens, which includes our own nature reserve.
  </p>
  <p>
    Established by a group of mums in 2004, Little Bears is an integral part
    of the community, providing excellent quality care where children can
    flourish. Our aim has always been to provide high quality childcare and
    education within a community Pre-School.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are a member of the Pre-School Learning Alliance, Ofsted registered and
    a registered charity (charity number 1099694).
  </p>
  <p>
    Our last Ofsted inspection, carried out in Feb 2018 rated Little Bears as
    &ldquo;Good&rdquo; overall and &ldquo;Outstanding&rdquo; in the area of
    personal development, behaviour and welfare.
