## Admissions

Children are eligible to join Little Bears from the start of term after
they turn two years old and can remain at the Pre-School until they start
the Reception Year of Primary/Infant School.

We run sessions Monday to Friday 9am &ndash; 12pm and 12pm &ndash; 3pm, excluding
Tuesday afternoon, when we are closed. Children are welcome to attend any
combination of sessions, subject to availability.  All children are
required to attend a minimum of two sessions per week or five once they
are entitled to funding.

Early registration is advisable. Our supervisor is always happy to discuss
individual needs as well as organising settling in sessions for your child
once a place is confirmed.
