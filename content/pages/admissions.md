# Admissions

## Admissions

Children are eligible to join Little Bears from the start of term after
they turn two years old and can remain at the Pre-School until they start
the Reception Year of Primary/Infant School.

We run sessions Monday to Friday 9am &ndash; 12pm and 12pm &ndash; 3pm.
Children are welcome to attend any combination of sessions, subject to
availability.  All children are required to attend a minimum of two sessions per
week or five once they are entitled to funding.

Early registration is advisable. Our supervisor is always happy to discuss
individual needs as well as organising settling in sessions for your child
once a place is confirmed.
