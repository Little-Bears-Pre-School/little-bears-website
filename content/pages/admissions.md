# Admissions

## Admissions

Children are eligible to join Little Bears from the start of term after
they turn two years old and can remain at the Pre-School until they start
the Reception Year of Primary/Infant School.

We run sessions Monday to Friday 9am &ndash; 12pm and 12pm &ndash; 3pm, excluding
Tuesday afternoon, when we are closed. Children are welcome to attend any
combination of sessions, subject to availability.  All children are
required to attend a minimum of two sessions per week or five once they
are entitled to funding.

Early registration is advisable. Our supervisor is always happy to discuss
individual needs as well as organising settling in sessions for your child
once a place is confirmed.

## Fees

From September 2024 our session fees are &pound;18.50 per 3 hour session for
children not eligible for funding.

Under the Early Years Free Entitlement system, all three and four year
olds are entitled to 15 hours per week from the term following their 3rd
birthday, for up to 38 weeks per year. Once your child becomes eligible
for funding, we do expect you to use your full 15 hours with us. We do not
currently accept extended hours funding. 

From April 2024 there are some changes to funded childcare for eligible working
families of 2 year olds.  Follow the link below to the Oxfordshire County
Council guidance on the eligibility criteria and how to apply.  If you are
entitled to this funding, please [contact us](/contact) so that we can confirm
your eligibility.  Please note, if you think you may be eligible, your child
must have turned 2 before the 31st March 2024 to be entitled to funding for the
Summer Term.
