# Policies

## Safeguarding

Little Bears has a duty under the law to help safeguard children against
suspected or actual &lsquo;significant harm&rsquo;. Our employment practices ensure
children against the likelihood of abuse at Little Bears and we have a
procedure for managing complaints or allegations against members of staff.

Our way of working with children and their parents ensures we are aware of
any problems as they emerge and that we can offer support where needed.
