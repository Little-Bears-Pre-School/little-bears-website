  <h2>Safeguarding</h2>
  <p>
    Little Bears has a duty under the law to help safeguard children against
    suspected or actual 'significant harm'. Our employment practices ensure
    children against the likelihood of abuse at Little Bears and we have a
    procedure for managing complaints or allegations against members of staff.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our way of working with children and their parents ensures we are aware of
    any problems as they emerge and that we can offer support where needed.
